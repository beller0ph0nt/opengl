/**
 * @file mali_dependency_system.h
 *
 * The Mali Dependency System is a independent dependency system that the Mali drivers use to
 * keep track on Read and Write dependencies between Surface Buffers (Resources), and the
 * entities (Framebuilders) that want to work on these surfaces (Consumers).
 * To rephrase it: Consumers (Frame builders) have read or write connections to several
 * Resources (surfaces). Other Consumers may be the Display driver that may held a
 * read dependency on a Resource (frame buffer) which is visible on screen.
 *
 * The reason why we introduce this somewhat complex Dependency System is that we want to
 * avoid to having the CPU to wait for a blocking dependency, when there are other things
 * that can be done. For example: we want to be able to start the GP job for a surface
 * even if the things we need for starting the PP job is not available. After that
 * we want to start the PP job when both the GP job is finished, and the surfaces this
 * PP job depends on. By letting the dependency system do these job starts from callbacks
 * when their list of dependencies are met, we do not need to have the functional but
 * slow locking system, that locks the CPU until the dependency is met.
 *
 * The basic entities are thus Resources which is allocated with: \a mali_ds_resource_allocate(),
 * and Consumers that are allocated through \a mali_ds_consumer_allocate().
 * You make a dependency between a Consumer and a Resource by: \a mali_ds_connect() where the
 * user also states whether the Consumer will Read or Write to the resource.
 * The consumer has an activation callback function that will be called when the Consumer should
 * start its work. The activation callback will normal start all the PP jobs for this consumer.
 *
 * When all the dependencies are added to the Consumer, it can be flushed. Flushing is to call
 * the function \a mali_ds_consumer_flush() on the consumer. This tells the Dependency system
 * that the consumer should get the Activation callback when all its dependencies are met.
 *
 * This is what we do in the activation function to the Frame today:
 * First we increase the Consumer ref count to the number of PP jobs we are about to start:
 * Calling * \a mali_ds_consumer_release_ref_count_change(frame->ds_consumer_pp_render,2)
 * the last number 2 indicates that it increases the ref count by 2.
 * Then it starts the PP jobs (2 in this case).
 *
 * The callback from the PP jobs when they are finished does this:
 * If the job fails it calls: \a mali_ds_consumer_set_error(consumer) And it always release
 * the reference count this job held:
 * \a mali_ds_consumer_release_ref_count_change(consumer,-1).
 *
 * When all (2) PP jobs are finished, the consumer is actually released, and the Dependency
 * System does the Release callback on the Consumer. The release callback will do the
 * _egl_mali_frame_swap() which shows the rendered image on screen. In this callback function
 * we also use the function \a mali_ds_connect_give_direct_ownership_and_flush() to transfer the rights
 * of the Frame Surface Resource from the Frame builder Consumer to the EGL Display consumer,
 * it will also release the previous EGL Display consumer so this can be used in the next
 * rendering.
 *
 * To see more (simple) examples of how the Dependency system works, see the test of it, found in
 * file \a dependency01.c in the testbench.

/** GDB Debugging
 * If the program goes into a deadlock state, it is possible to connect GDB into it and find
 * what it blocks on. To connect to a program with gdb: "attatch PID"
 * Then it is possible to call the internals of the print functions:
 * \a mali_dependency_system_debug_print_consumer() \a mali_dependency_system_debug_print_consumer()
 * which should not be called from GDB.
 * The internals that does not take the mutexes and Can be called from GDB are called:
 * \a debug_ds_system_print_consumer(consumer) and \a debug_ds_system_print_resource(resource) .
 * To run this function: "call debug_ds_system_print_consumer(0xADDR_CONSUMER)" */
