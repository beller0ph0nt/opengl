 * The GP job system.
 * All access to the mali hardware goes through a job system. Jobs are created
 * by the user and queued for execution. The Vertex Shader (VS) and the Polygon
 * List Builder Unit (PLBU), use a common job definition. A job can contain
 * commmand lists for both the PLBU and the VS. If a VS and a PLBU job depend
 * on each other they must be added to a single GP job handle so they are
 * handled together by the lower systems.
