/**
 * Performs incremental rendering and a readback on the given frame builder. This function is
 * synchronous so when it returns all geometry that have previously been added to the frame builder
 * for processing (draw calls, etc) will have been rendered off-screen and deleted. In addition the
 * color, depth and stencil buffers will have been added to the frame builder as textured quads so
 * that they will be included in the final frame.
 *
 * In other words the following is done in an incremental rendering cycle:
 *  1. render to texture
 *  2. reset the frame builder
 *  3. read textures back in again
 *
 * @note Calling this function will reset the frame_builder, including calling all callbacks that
 *       have been added to it
 * @note It is allowed to add more geometry to the frame builder for the current frame after
 *       calling this function. That geometry will then be rendered on top of the textured quad
 *       containing the results of previous draw calls, etc.
 * @note Calling this function will effectively erase the GP Vertex Shader and PLBU command list,
 *       which means that the VS/PLBU state represented by these will be reset. If you need to
 *       continue rendering with this state after calling this function then you must add commands
 *       to the VS and PLBU command lists to recreate it
 * @note If a failure occurs then the framebuffer results are undefined
 *
 * @param frame_builder          - The frame builder to perform incremental rendering on, thereby
 *                                 resolving all previously registered draw calls/geometry
 * @return An error code if something went wrong
